🚄 VITrails: Console-Based Railway Booking Simulation
VITrail is a specialized Integrated Smart Railway App. It delivers real-time train tracking (location, delay, platform) and secure ticket booking (including Tatkal). Features include instant PNR verification and integrated on-board services (food, Wi-Fi). VITrail provides a unified, modern interface for efficient, informed, and hassle-free railway travel.
This Python script is a simplified, console-based simulation of the core booking functionality for this proposed system.
🌟 Features
The simulation provides the following key functionalities:
Route Search: Allows users to search for available trains between defined source and destination cities (BHOPAL, AMARAVATI, VELLORE, CHENNAI).
Date Validation: Enforces a valid travel date format (DDMMYYYY) and ensures the booking is for the present day or a future date.
Train Selection: Enables the user to choose a train from the filtered list.
Seat Allotment Simulation: Randomly assigns a Coach and Seat Number, and determines the final berth type (Lower, Middle, Upper, etc.).
Mock Payment Gateway: Simulates a financial transaction with basic card/PIN validation and a processing delay.
Ticket Generation: Prints a structured, finalized ticket with all journey and allotment details upon successful payment.
⚙️ How It Works: Berth Allotment Logic
The most detailed part of the simulation is the seat allotment, which mimics the standard 8-berth bay layout common in Indian Railways coaches:
Seat No. % 8 Remainder
Berth Type
Code
1 or 4
Lower Berth
LB
2 or 5
Middle Berth
MB
3 or 6
Upper Berth
UB
7
Side Lower
SL
0
Side Upper
SU

The script randomly generates a seat number (1-72) and applies this remainder logic to determine the allotted berth type.
🛠️ Prerequisites
This script requires only a standard Python installation (Python 3.6+ is recommended). It uses only built-in modules:
datetime
time
random
🚀 How to Run
Save the code as a Python file (e.g., vitrails_booking.py).
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Run the script using the Python interpreter:
python vitrails_booking.py


Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your source city, destination city, travel date, and seat preferences.
